This project creates a stylish calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML defines the structure with a table layout for the buttons and display. 
CSS enhances the appearance with a modern look, including a dark background, white card-like container, and color-coded buttons for operations and functions.
JavaScript handles the calculator logic, allowing for number and operator inputs, clearing the display, and evaluating the expressions.
